# Game_of_life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

It is a game where evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves.

As a huge fan of Conway's work, his beautiful mind and his charimatic and genius approach to mathematics in general, I chose to implement this game for a final project of my Python programming course during my studies.
